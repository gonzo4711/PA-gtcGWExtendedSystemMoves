Planetary Annihilation Mod - Move over explored systems (Galactic War)

### Why creating this mod?

After playing "Galactic War" it's getting very costly to move to any explored system.
If you explored the left-side of an Galayx and you will continue on the right-side, you have to click, wait, move and click - system by stystem...

### What are the features?

Now you can easily move from any explored system to any other explored (or connected-enemy) system.

### Updatelog:

#### Version 1.1
* Bugfix in routing (couldn't find the smallest route in some cases)
* Faster pathfinding (only stores the closest route, skips possible larger routes)
* Removed "step-setting" from Settings-UI-Tab (not necessary anymore)
* Caching for the last route (no re-calculation after click on "JUMP")
* Moving to any connected enemy-system is possible now
