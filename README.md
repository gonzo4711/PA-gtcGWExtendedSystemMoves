Planetary Annihilation Mod - Move over explored systems (Galactic War)

### Why creating this mod?

After playing "Galactic War" it's getting very costly to move to any explored system.
If you explored the left-side of an Galayx and you will continue on the right-side, you have to click, wait, move and click - system by stystem...

### What are the features?

Now you can easily move from any explored system to any other explored system.
Moving from a non-nearby system to an enemy system is impossible.

Calculating the smallest route between two systems is very hard for slow PC's or a large-explored-galaxy.
So, to prevent - so there can be a delay (1-2 sec) after clicking on a system and see any "JUMP", "EXPLORE","FIGHT" Button.

To prevent such a delay, you can manage the maximum move size in the Settings (UI)
